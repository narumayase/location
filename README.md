### Example running locally

* Set environment variable LOCATION_ENVIRONMENT=local. 

```
$ export LOCATION_ENVIRONMENT=local
```

* Run: 

```
$ go build
$ go run main.go
```

* To check coverage:

```
$ go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

?   	location	[no test files]

$ sudo docker image build -t location:0.0.1 .
$ sudo docker run --network host location:0.0.1
```

### API 

More detailed Swagger documentation in the file [swagger.yaml](https://github.com/narumayase/location/blob/master/swagger.yaml).

This API is used to register branch offices, to get the branch by id and also to find the closest branch office to a given point. This point must be expressed in latitude and longitude in simple decimal coordinates with the following format:

Buenos Aires location example:

```
Latitude:-34.6083
Longitude:-58.3712
```

* Branch office creation

Allows you to create a branch with its latitude, longitude and address.

```
request:

POST http://localhost:8080/branch-offices/branch-office

{
    "latitude":-34.6083,
    "longitude":-58.3712,
    "address":"just a random address 123"
}

response:

200 OK

{
    "id":1,
    "latitude":-34.6083,
    "longitude":-58.3712,
    "address":"just a random address 123"
}
```

Example:

```
$ curl -v -d '{"longitude":-58.45678, "latitude":-34.12345, "address":"buenos aires 1234"}' POST http://localhost:8080/branch-offices/branch-office
```

```

* Get branch office by ID

It allows to obtain the data of the branch knowing its id.

```

```

* Find the nearest branch office

Allows you to search for the closest branch to the chosen point (latitude and longitude).
